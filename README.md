## Plans and projects
Currently I'm getting into web development, having learned HTML and CSS, and aiming to learn JavaScript, Node.js, React and Next.js.
I also would like to learn backend development and planning a roadmap for such.
Furthermore, I wuold like to keep exploring the possibilities of programming languages, as I'm learning Go and will learn Rust for college.
My main goal right now is to find what area suits me more and try to specialize on it and give my best for it, either to work for a company
or to be an entrepreneur.
