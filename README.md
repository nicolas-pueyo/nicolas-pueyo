- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m NicolÃ¡s.
- I am studying the first course of computer engineering at the University of Zaragoza
- I am willing to be taught and learn as much as I can about this fascinating world.
- This profile will contain mainly repositories of my lessons and work for college, for those who are interested in base level coding
or how universities teach programming.
- I will also be sharing this profile with some of my colleagues.
- Feel free to reach me out.
